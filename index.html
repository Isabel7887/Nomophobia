    <h3 class="Home"> What is Nomophobia? </h3>
   <p> If we stop to think about what we look at most during the day, the answer would probably not be our family or friends, nor television or books. The most feasible option would be the mobile phone. That small device that forms a large part of our lives with work emails, instant messages, social networks or videos on demand. In extreme cases, it can lead to what is known as "nomophobia", a disorder that experts have described as the disease of the 21st century.</p>
    <p> Nomophobia is the irrational fear of being without a mobile phone. The term was coined in 2009 and comes from the anglicism "nomophobia" ("no-mobile-phone-phobia"). The dependence on the electronic device causes an unfounded sense of communication in the user who does not have the device, either because they have left it at home, the battery has run out or they are out of range. In this vein, a YouGov Real Time study in 2019 found that 44% people were anxious if they could not use their cell phone to "keep in touch" with their circle. Although the WHO has not yet classified nomophobia as a mental pathology, experts warn of the growing dependence on this small electronic device. </p>
    <h3 class="Home"> Adicted to Tecnology? </h3>
    <p> Chronic phone use is a recently developed form of addiction. The American Psychiatric Association does not officially recognize the condition. Still, it is acknowledged as a behavioral addiction by many medical professionals and researchers worldwide. According to several studies, over time, the devoted use of smartphones can alter and negatively affect an individual. </p>
