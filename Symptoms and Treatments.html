    <h3 class="Home"> Symptoms and Sings: </h3>
<ul>> Lying about smartphone use.</ul>
<ul>> Loved ones expressing concern.</ul>
<ul>> Neglect or trouble completing work, school, or home duties.</ul>
<ul>> More and more time using a phone.</ul>
<ul>> Checking peoples’ profiles repeatedly due to anxiety.</ul>
<ul>> Accidents or injury due to phone use.</ul>
<ul>> Working later to complete tasks.</ul>
<ul>> Weak or non-existent social life.</ul>
<ul>> Fear of missing out.</ul>
<ul>> Isolation from loved ones.</ul>
<ul>> A feeling of lack of connection.</ul>
<ul>> Angry or irritated if phone use is interrupted.</ul>
<ul>> Getting up at night to check a phone.</ul>
<ul>> Reaching for the phone when alone or bored.</ul>
<ul>> Phantom vibrations (thinking the phone buzzes when it doesn’t).</ul>
<ul>> Limiting phone use is difficult.</ul>
<ul>> Craving access to a smartphone or another device.</ul>
<p>It is essential to remember that no specific amount of time, frequency, or message is sent to indicate phone addiction. Yet an accumulation of the above warning signs indicates an underlying phone use problem.</p>
       <h3 class="Home"> Treatments </h3>
    <p> As with all addictions, prevention is the key. There are some simple actions to prevent excessive use of mobile phones from leading to extreme dependence or a major disorder. Among the most effective are the following:</p>
<ul> >Uninstall some applications that we consider to be time-wasters such as games </ul>
 <ul>>Do not use at mealtimes</ul>
 <ul>>Mute notifications</ul>
 <ul>>Set specific times to consult it and decrease the time of use</ul>
   <ul> >Never look at it if we are chatting, eating, sharing leisure time with other people.</ul>
    <ul> >Do not use it as an alarm clock, as it can interfere with our sleep cycle.</ul>
   <ul> >Carry it out of the bedroom.</ul>
    <ul>>Going out on the streets without a telephone.</ul>
    <p> It is essential that we accept that we cannot have our mobile phones at our disposal at all times and that we create our own commitment to the healthy use of technology. In the most extreme cases, we should see a specialist. Treatment will depend on each person's level of self-control. If this still exists, we will proceed to the progressive elimination of dependence on the mobile phone. If it is no longer possible to manage the anxiety, the treatment will be a shock treatment supervised by a mental health specialist who will help to cope with the negative feelings while disengagement is achieved. </p>
